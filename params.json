They both do the same and the service is just a GUI wrapper for the script.\r\n\r\nThe script monitors for a file to change in the specified folder. If it sees a change then an embedded apple script is used to refresh the browser of your choosing. You can currently choose between safari and chrome. There is a keyword that is used to identify which browser tabs will be refreshed. i.e. a keyword of \"localhost\" will only refresh browser pages with \"localhost\" in the URL.\r\n\r\nThis program is based on [a post by Brett Terpstra] (http://goo.gl/jo469J)\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n#### Service (Workflow)\r\nTo install the service simple double click on the Watcher.workflow and select **Install**. \r\n\r\nAfter this you can right click on the folder you want to watch and under **Services** select **Watcher**\r\n\r\n#### Ruby Script\r\nTo run the ruby script navigate to the install folder and run the following:\r\n\r\n    ./watcher.rb path_to_watch keyword browser\r\n\r\nCurrently the only supported browsers are chrome and safari. both must be entered all lower case.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
